# V0.4.13
## Test cases
* skip test for pipeline for now on github actions linux environment [984a667](https://github.com/qutang/arus/commit/984a667)
* use 'threads" scheduler in pipeline test cases [3cc8971](https://github.com/qutang/arus/commit/3cc8971)
* add an example for single stream pipeline [dcd734a](https://github.com/qutang/arus/commit/dcd734a)
## Features
* Support threads scheduler in pipeline [b13094b](https://github.com/qutang/arus/commit/b13094b)
* add "max_processes" to the pipeline constructor to set the maximum processes to be used [cdfb092](https://github.com/qutang/arus/commit/cdfb092)
* `Pipeline` class now works for multiple streams [bbe891e](https://github.com/qutang/arus/commit/bbe891e)
* Add `SensorGeneratorStream` class to support streaming randomly generated accelerometer data [5e6c308](https://github.com/qutang/arus/commit/5e6c308)
* add function to generate random accelerometer data with normal distribution [071216f](https://github.com/qutang/arus/commit/071216f)
* add new features [662919b](https://github.com/qutang/arus/commit/662919b)
* implement pipeline base class (in [dev)](https://github.com/qutang/arus/commit/dev))
* the output from `SensorFileStream` and `AnnotationFileStream` class includes meta data [9b82fb0](https://github.com/qutang/arus/commit/9b82fb0)
* support `exception_type` of "missing" for mhealth sensor test data [8f10c05](https://github.com/qutang/arus/commit/8f10c05)
## Bug fixes
* Quit `SensorGeneratorStream` when `stop` is called normally [1fedf65](https://github.com/qutang/arus/commit/1fedf65)
* syntax error in pipeline.py [9377c3e](https://github.com/qutang/arus/commit/9377c3e)
* fix actigraph sensor test data storage structure [77c4c5a](https://github.com/qutang/arus/commit/77c4c5a)
