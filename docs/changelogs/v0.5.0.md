# V0.5.0
## Test cases
* Add an example of pipeline with one stream and one pipeline as input [c2aad50](https://github.com/qutang/arus/commit/c2aad50)
* Use 1 decimal precision in generator test (because of small chance of failure) [a481ea4](https://github.com/qutang/arus/commit/a481ea4)
* Add example for pipeline when preserve_status is set to be `True` [a13d0b1](https://github.com/qutang/arus/commit/a13d0b1)
* Add `sr` to generator config in the examples [4c89a50](https://github.com/qutang/arus/commit/4c89a50)
* Add an example for pipeline using both sensor and annotation streams [c3b0a9e](https://github.com/qutang/arus/commit/c3b0a9e)
* Add annotation generator stream test case [8e65df0](https://github.com/qutang/arus/commit/8e65df0)
## Bug fixes
* Fix racing bug when shutting down the pipeline [b40c09c](https://github.com/qutang/arus/commit/b40c09c)
* Remove `sr` from the argument list of `GeneratorSlidingWindowStream` class [d9ff23b](https://github.com/qutang/arus/commit/d9ff23b)
* return empty chunks if the loaded data is empty for `SlidingWindowStream` [e490896](https://github.com/qutang/arus/commit/e490896)
* update `Pipeline` class to meet the changes in `Stream` class [6c14f05](https://github.com/qutang/arus/commit/6c14f05)
* use float microseconds when generating timestamps for sensor data [ee9d008](https://github.com/qutang/arus/commit/ee9d008)
## Features
* Provide previous input and output in the processor [2a50b10](https://github.com/qutang/arus/commit/2a50b10)
* Use `None` for previous window st and et for the first window of the stream [6013a73](https://github.com/qutang/arus/commit/6013a73)
* Pipeline output has the same tuple structure as streams, close #59 [aca5f34](https://github.com/qutang/arus/commit/aca5f34)
* Output includes current and previous window boundaries, name, and data for stream [d2a32c3](https://github.com/qutang/arus/commit/d2a32c3)
* Add `generator` function for annotations [502c435](https://github.com/qutang/arus/commit/502c435)
## Refactors
* add a convenient way to import mhealth_format modules as a whole [41b3ab5](https://github.com/qutang/arus/commit/41b3ab5)
* change package structure for `Stream` classes [185f88a](https://github.com/qutang/arus/commit/185f88a)
