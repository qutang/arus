    This captures the mean duration of activation intervals within the window, normalized by the window length. An activation interval is defined as the amount of samples between two consecutive threshold crossings.

    This feature captures the standard deviation of the duration of activation intervals within the window, normalized by the window length, thereby providing information on uniformity of activation intervals within the window. This feature may help discriminate between activities with cyclic movements with a very stable ratio between active and inactive phases, and more random activities. A stable cyclic movement would result in lower variability of activation intervals that would repeat themselves within the window. Fast and aperiodic movements, however, such as those in recreational activities would result in highly variable activation bouts.
